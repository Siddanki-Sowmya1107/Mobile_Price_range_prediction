# Mobile_Price_range_prediction
This machine learning project predicts mobile prices using decision tree classifier, KNN, logistic regression, and random forest algorithms. Decision tree offers interpretability, KNN relies on neighbors, logistic regression models binary outcomes, and random forest combines multiple trees for accuracy. The ensemble methods like random forest often outperform individualÂ models.
